# Overview

Online hate speech is a growing problem worldwide, causing harm to users, polluting online communities, and potentially leading to offline violence. Social media platforms facilitate the rapid propagation of hateful content. However, in regions like Africa, interventions primarily focus on high-profile individuals, often through labour-intensive human moderation which is not scalable. Furthermore, there is limited availability of machine learning tools for African languages due to the scarcity of labeled datasets.

AfriHate introduces the first high-quality labeled social media dataset collection for detecting hate and abusive language in 17 African languages. The datasets will be used in the AfriHate Shared Task, co-located with AfricaNLP 2025, a shared task on hate speech and abusive language detection in African languages with two tracks.

# Rationale of the Shared Task

Africa is home to over 2000 languages, including 75 languages with at least one million speakers each. Despite this linguistic richness, African languages are under-served in NLP. Our datasets aim to create a more inclusive digital landscape by supporting African languages and addressing language-specific challenges and nuances in hate speech detection.

# Participants

- Researchers in low-resource African languages and socio-linguistic phenomena.
- Researchers studying machine learning approaches for hate speech detection.

# Languages

# Tracks

## Track 1: Category Classification

Given a social media post, classify it into one of three categories: Hate, Offensive, or Normal. This track focuses on understanding the type of language used in the posts and categorizing them accordingly.

## Track 2: Target Classification

Determine the target attribute of the offensiveness in a given social media post. The possible targets include: Ethnicity, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Disability, or Gender. This track aims to identify which group is the target of the offensive content.

# Baselines and Evaluation

Baseline models will be shared, and performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-F1 metrics.

  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How was the data collected?</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>
   The data collection process a standard one, you can check previous papers in the area to have an idea (e.g., https://aclanthology.org/S18-1001.pdf). We have data instances (text snippets) annotated by >3 annotators. The annotators decide whether the text convey some kind of hate or offensive content. 
   For details about the data sources, annotation guidelines, number of annotators per language, etc., please check our paper, Muhammad et al. (2025).
    </li>
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How was the data annotated and did you use LLMs to annotate it?</summary>
   <ul>
    <li>
  No. The data instances were annotated by (>=3) native speakers and no LLMs were involved in the process. The annotators labeled the whole sentences not the words.
    </li>
   </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Will I be included in the final ranking if I do not write a system description paper?</summary>
